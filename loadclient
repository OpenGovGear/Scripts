#This script runs on the staging server once the client if
#ready to go into prod. It creates a production.ini file, a 
#database dump file, and loads them as well as any custom plug-ins
#to git, where they'll be launched into production. The image must have
#GIT installed, and either pre-configured with the ID and password of 
#the GIT admin, or this script can identify that user, but credential 
#helper must be there

#question: how to set git up on this server as well as on remote server to 
#enable the required interaction?
